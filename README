Java library for encoding and decoding data in LZF format,
written by Tatu Saloranta (tatu.saloranta@iki.fi)

Data format and algorithm based on original LZF library
(http://freshmeat.net/projects/liblzf) by Marc A Lehmann

Format differs slightly from some other adaptations, such as
one used by H2 database project
(http://www.h2database.com, by Thomas Mueller); although internal
block compression structure is the same, block identifiers
differ: this package uses the original LZF identifiers to be 100%
compatible with existing command-line lzf tool(s).
