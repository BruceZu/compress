Java library for encoding and decoding data in LZF format,
written by Tatu Saloranta (tatu.saloranta@iki.fi)

Data format and algorithm based on original LZF library
(http://freshmeat.net/projects/liblzf) by Marc A Lehmann

Format differs slightly from some other adaptations, such as
one used by H2 database project
(http://www.h2database.com, by Thomas Mueller); although internal
block compression structure is the same, block identifiers
differ: this package uses the original LZF identifiers to be 100%
compatible with existing command-line lzf tool(s).

LZF alfgorithm itself is optimized for speed, with somewhat more modest
compression: comparess to Deflate (algorithm gzip uses) LZF can be
up to three times as fast to compress, and 50% faster to decompress.

Note that resulting jar is both an OSGi bundle, and a command-line tool
(has manifest that points to 'com.ning.compress.lzf.LZF' as the class
having main() method to call).
This means that you can use it like:

  java -jar compress-lzf-0.6.1.jar
  
(which will display necessary usage arguments)
